# Kreativstorm Week 3 Project: Rock Paper Scissors Game

https://seankennelly.github.io/kreativstorm-RPS-game/

## The Game
The game is simply Rock, Paper, Scissors. The user can win, lose or draw on each round. After five rounds the scores are added up. Due to the potential for draws in rounds, the final score can also be a win, loss or draw.

## Scenarios
The code has been designed to handle the following scenarios:
* The user's input does not match the intended options (ie. Random strings, numbers, symbols etc)
* The user's input is not formatted correctly (ie. 'rock', 'paPer' (capitalised incorrectly))
* The user does not type anything before pressing OK or 'enter'
* The user's input is correct (program will run as normal)

## Testing
In reaction to the four scenarios listed above, four separate prompts can be reached by the user. There is potential for each scenario (correct or incorrect) to then be executed in each of the four prompts. This has been tested for, with results recorded here:
